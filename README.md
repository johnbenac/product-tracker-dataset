This repo is a Markdown-canonical dataset for testing schema-driven CRUD + navigation + relationships.

Key features:
- Types are stored as Markdown records under /types
- Records live under /records/<recordTypeId>/
- Relationships appear in YAML reference fields and also as Obsidian-style [[wiki-links]] in bodies
